# 840 Docs

Experimental system for software (and other) documentation for my robotics team.     
Might be used, might not be used. If used, it'll probably be migrated to a cooler and better place.

Thanks to [Highlander Robotics](https://github.com/HighlanderRobotics/Highlanders-Training) for inspiration to do it in this style (and also how they did markdown assets and stuff).
