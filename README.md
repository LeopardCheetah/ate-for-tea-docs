# 840 Docs

---

Experimental system for software (and other) documentation for my robotics team.     
Might be used, might not be used. If used, it'll probably be migrated to a cooler and better place. Also, don't expect this to be the most comprehensive thing ever -- I'm not trying to explain every single thing about FRC programming, I'm just touching on the big points and consider this a supplement for whatever training is happening.

Thanks to [Highlander Robotics](https://github.com/HighlanderRobotics/Highlanders-Training) for inspiration to do it in this style (and also how they did markdown assets and stuff).

The [todo list](todo.md) is stuff that I want written that maybe will be written later.
