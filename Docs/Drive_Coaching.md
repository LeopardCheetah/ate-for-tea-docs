# Drive Coaching

(I'm too lazy to put my thoughts in a doc and I guess I like the formatting -- oh well).

---

Drive coaching essentially means being the guy directing the drivers to do stuff and so on. Drive coaches are that 3rd person behind the glass usually yelling at drivers and/or calling time or rushing over to other teams' stations. So what do they do exactly?

## Responsibilities


### General

- Have a good relationship with the drivers and communicate effectively    
- Know the meta, common strategies, and possible strategy counters    
- Know the robots. That doesn't mean you have to know each one individually 100% before the comp even starts, but it does mean know the basic robot archetypes, know who's who (and by extension, who's good and who's not), and generally you *should* be able to have a sense of how good a team is just by looking at their robot (no matches)        
- Work well with other people (alliance partners, etc.)     
And most important,    
- **Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.**

### Pre-Match

1. Review the next Qualification Match. Who are you playing against? Who are you playing with? Who's projected[^1] to win? What's the strat? Should you go for point points to win or ranking points?    
2. Meetup with your alliance partners and talk over the strategy. What's going on in auto? What's going on in teleop? Who's cycling where? Is anyone climbing? Make sure to always **be flexible** and generally, value the alliance above yourself. Other than that, strategies change -- robots could be broken one match fixed the next, unforeseen situations can arise -- so there's no need to stick to something super solid. It's ok to say "let's talk this out in queue".    
3. Brief the drivers + whoever else is necessary on the strategy.     
4. Bring your robot to queue and hash out the strategy there.     
4.5. Also, remember to keep an eye on your alliance partners' robots. You may even consider helping fix their robot if the next match is crucial and you have some spare manpower. In general, you shouldn't defer to your alliance partners on everything, and it's always nice to swing by the pits to check-in and help out other teams.    


### Queue/In-Match

0. Go over the strategy again, and emphasize key points.    
1. Make sure the robot is set in the right location, and the auto is chosen correctly.    
2. Advise the drivers! This usually boils down to:   
--> Communicate with them. Give them information they aren't focused on or can't know, like match score (we're leading by 10/20), match time (40 seconds left), or perhaps where to pick up the next game piece or if there's traffic on the field. The way I see it, the drivers execute and the drive coach acts as the "brain" for the team.    
--> Communicate with the other alliances! Tell them you broke or you're having trouble if you're having trouble, and be prepared to switch strategies on the fly.    
--> Keep an eye on your alliance. Keep an eye on your alliance to make sure plans are going well, and if plans aren't going well (for whatever reason), be able to adapt to help your alliance partners (e.g. alliance partner's intake broke, so go score in place of them). If for whatever reason, an alliance partner is going against strategy or is just not at all helping, leave them alone and focus on your objectives. Hash out your difference post-match.    
--> Keep an eye on the opposing alliance. Where are their robots? Any chance you could slightly bump them? Can you steal a game piece from them? What strategy are they running? These are all important things that can help you get a sense for where they are and can help you more effectively counter them.    
2.5. Also, yell at your drivers if they're not getting the memo. Don't be mean about it, but if something needs to be done, it needs to be done.

### Post-Match

1. Thank your alliance partners for helping and playing with you, and give props to the drivers for their driving. A little encouragement and positivity goes a long way.    
2. Get the bot off the field + get any robot issues fixed. As the drive coach (and drivers), you have one of the best views for what went wrong with your robot, considering you're field-side, you have access to Driver Station, and you most likely know what went on right before the code error. Robotics is contingent on reliability, so **always** communicate and contribute whatever issues you noticed to your team.    
3. Review the match from a coach/strategy standpoint. What went well? What didn't go so well? What could've been done better? What was done well? And maybe talk with your drivers if some big issues come up. Worst-case, DNP someone.    
4. Relax + Prepare for your next match :>

## Miscellaneous

- Always be cool to the drivers. While a drive coach is 'the brain' on the field, at the end of the day, the drivers most likely know more about the robot controls and movement than you. If something goes wrong, they'll probably know why, and sometimes, you just gotta let them take care of it.     
- Always be cool to other teams. This is pretty-self explanatory.    
- Although it isn't necessary, drive coach puts you in a perfect place to "network" or "make connections" or generally, just meet cool people. 95% of people at comps (and 99% of people you work with) are cool, and drive coaching is a great way to get to know some cool people.      
- Know some scouting. While your job is to get matches won and ranking points won, as a drive coach, you have one of the best locations to go scouting with -- field-side, next to robots, and you can see how a drive team interacts (and you can literally see their bot moving back and forth). Obviously, don't pull out Lovat and start scouting, but you should get a sense of who's good and who's not as good from your time behind the glass.

[^1]: Don't take projections too seriously. By that, I mean fate is usually always in *your* or *your team's hands*. If you're predicted win percentage is 90%+, it is safe to say that you're probably gonna win. Otherwise, anything can happen, and be ready to switch to a strategy to score points -- maybe another robot breaks, maybe one of your robots that was breaking works, etc etc.     
Also, on that note, most everyone is looking at the same projections. I can see as well as you do the "65% win percentage" that Statbotics has so graciously provided us with. No need to reiterate on this point many times.
