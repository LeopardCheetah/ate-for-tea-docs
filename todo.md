List of files that I would want written:   

Basic:   
~~- Git Usage (and sample git repo)~~    
> - Brief intro to git branches and that stuff     
~~- Code Structure (how does the code actually work and run? organization?)~~    

- how to write a file (e.g. `elevator.java`)     
- maybe creating a new example project


Not basic:
- Trapezoidal Documentation     
- Auto Config (how to setup)
