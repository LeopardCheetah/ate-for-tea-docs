List of files that I would want written:   

Basic:   
~~- Git Usage (and sample git repo)~~    
> - Brief intro to git branches and that stuff     
~~- Code Structure (how does the code actually work and run? organization?)~~    

~~- how to write a file (e.g. `elevator.java`) (WIP! see subsystem)~~    
~~- coding principles (not standards but the way code is written)~~ -- cut unless code standards wants to come out of the grave here       
~~- a way to think about code structure (what interacts with what?) (pyramid of subsystems/commands) (also touch on encapsulation)~~


Not basic:
- Trapezoidal Documentation     
~~- Auto Config (how to setup)~~ nah i'll let them suffer or write it later
