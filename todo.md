List of files that I would want written:   

Basic:   
~~- Git Usage (and sample git repo)~~    
> - Brief intro to git branches and that stuff     
~~- Code Structure (how does the code actually work and run? organization?)~~    

- how to write a file (e.g. `elevator.java`) (WIP! see subsystem)    
- coding principles (not standards but the way code is written)   
- a way to think about code structure (what interacts with what?)


Not basic:
- Trapezoidal Documentation     
- Auto Config (how to setup)
